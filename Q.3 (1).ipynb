    "In Python, the abc module stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" \n",
    "It is a module that provides mechanisms for defining abstract \n",
    "base classes in Python. Abstract base classes are a way to define\n",

    "\n",
    "The abc module is used for several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Defining Abstract Base Classes: You can use the abc module to \n",
    "create abstract base classes by subclassing the ABC class \n",
    "provided by the module. These abstract base classes can define \n",
    "abstract methods, which are methods that have no implementation \n",
    "in the base class but must be implemented in concrete (derived) \n",
    "classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enforcing Method Implementation: When you define abstract \n",
    "methods in an abstract base class, any concrete subclass that \n",
    "inherits from the abstract base class must implement these \n",
    "methods. If a subclass fails to implement one of these abstract\n",
    "methods, Python will raise a TypeError at runtime, indicating\n",
    "that the subclass is not \"concrete\" enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Providing a Common Interface: Abstract base classes allow you\n",
    "to define a common interface that multiple classes can adhere \n",
    "to, ensuring that they provide specific functionality. This can\n",
    "help make your code more predictable and maintainable.\n",
